# Stackoverflow mock
This web application features a question and answer forum where users can seek help and advice from professionals and enthusiasts around the world. It is a clone of the popular stackoverflow website that we created for our SOEN-341 course at Concordia University.

The main objective of this application is to create a medium which makes it easy for people to obtain reliable and trustworthy information to help them understand any STEM related problems they may be facing. 

Users can post questions and answer other people's questions to gain points and increase their reputation in the forum. The more people upvote your answer to a question, the more points you gain!
