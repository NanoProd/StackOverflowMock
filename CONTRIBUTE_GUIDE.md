## Branches
### Work on Sprint Tasks
Branches associated with issues that represent tasks in the Sprint Backlog are to be named as follows:
<br>
`<task-id>/<issue-number>`
<br><br>
For example:<br>
Assume issue #12 was created for task with id **EG-1-3**, then the corresponding branch will be named as follows:
<br>
`eg-1-3/12` (*Notice the letters are all small caps.*)
### Work on other issues
Branches associated with issues that do NOT represent tasks in the Sprint should be named as follows:
<br>
`<descriptive-title>/<issue-number>`
<br><br>
Where `<descriptive-title>` should be clear, concise, and representative of the goals associated with the issue.
<br><br>
For example:<br>
Assume issue #30 is related to documentation work where a UML diagram is to be added. A possible branch name could be:<br>
`doc/add-uml-diagram/30` (*Notice how 'doc/' categorizes the type of work being done.*)
### Work not related to issues
Branches should ALWAYS be associated with an issue!
